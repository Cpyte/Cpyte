Check out the official documentation [here](https://gitea.5gnew.io.vn/duytung/Cpyte/src/branch/main/source/cpyte/cpy_language_documentation.md).

**Note:** Version 1.6.1 had a critical division by zero error that wasn't caught.

## Package Extensions

Cpyte supports a package extension system that allows packages to extend the compiler with custom keywords, operators, and compiler hooks. Packages can provide:

- **Custom Keywords**: Add new language keywords via `package.json`
- **Custom Operators**: Define new operators for syntax extensions  
- **Compiler Hooks**: Extend lexing, parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation
- **Runtime Extensions**: Add runtime code and libraries

### Package Structure

Packages are stored in `.cpm/modules/package_name/version/` and can include:

- `package.json` - Extension manifest declaring capabilities
- `parser_hooks.py` - Custom syntax extensions
- `semantic_hooks.py` - Custom type checking and analysis rules
- `codegen_hooks.py` - Custom LLVM IR generation
- `runtime_hooks.py` - Runtime code and libraries
- `*.cpy` - Main package entry point
- `*.ll` - Prebuilt LLVM IR

### Example Package

See `examples/example_package/` for a complete example package with:
- Custom keywords: `async`, `await`, `defer`
- Custom operator: `~~`
- Parser, semantic, codegen, and runtime hooks

### Using Extension Packages

```cpy
import @package_name

# Use custom keywords and syntax from the package
async def my_function() -> Promise:
    # Custom syntax
    defer cleanup()
    return result
```

## Examples

You'll find comprehensive examples in the `examples/` directory that cover C imports, header imports, 64-bit support, and standard library usage:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `examples/c_import_example.cpy` | Importing and calling functions from C source files |
| `examples/example_math.c` | C source with math utility functions for the C import example |
| `examples/h_import_example.cpy` | Importing functions declared in C header files |
| `examples/example_functions.h` / `example_functions.c` | Header and implementation for the H import example |
| `examples/64bit_example.cpy` | Comprehensive `int64`/`uint64` arithmetic, hex literals, type promotion |
| `examples/c_library_imports.cpy` | Using built-in C libraries (stdio, stdlib, math, string, time) |
| `examples/mixed_features.cpy` | Combines C imports, H imports, 64-bit, structs, pointers, linked lists |
| `examples/mixed_helpers.c` / `mixed_helpers.h` | Supporting C/header files for the mixed features example |
| `examples/test.cpy` | macOS event tap example that intercepts keyboard events using ApplicationServices framework |
| `examples/example_package/` | Example package demonstrating extension capabilities with custom keywords, operators, and compiler hooks |

You can also import `.cpy` files — the examples show how to use `import "other.cpy"` to bring in public functions and structs from other Cpy files.

Run any example with:
```bash
python source/mainpie.py --jit examples/<filename>.cpy
```

## Note
Cpyte is experimental software. The compiler is continuously tested with fuzzing, and we're still discovering and fixing correctness bugs. While many programs compile and run correctly, I can't make any guarantees about correctness or stability.

If you decide to use Cpyte, always use the latest version — older versions have bugs that are pretty easy to run into.
